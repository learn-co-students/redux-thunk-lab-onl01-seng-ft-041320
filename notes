INSTRUCTIONS
We'll have one top-level component, `App`
import connect from react-redux
use function mapStateToProps to connect the data to it's child presentaional component
will have child presentational component `CatList`
`CatList` will receive the list of cat pics from APP and render them in a series of <img> tags.
using an Api FETCH to get cats pics
we'll need to set up Redux and Thunk

Part 1: Set UP the Store and Reducer and Action Creater
use Redux's `createStore()` in `src/index.js`
import `createStore` from `redux` and `Provider from react-redux`
import a reducer, from `src/reducers/catsReducer.js`
pass reducer into `createStore` assing return value to `store`
store = createStore(reducer)
wrap the APP in Provider and pass store
setup reducer catsReducer()

setup action createStore
fetchCatgs() `src/actions/catActions`
thunk alters the behavior of action creatore functions allowing us to return a function that takes in dispatch

Part 2: Build the Container Componen
